# React Practice App README

Welcome to the React Practice App! This repository serves as a practice project for learning and experimenting with React.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. This will start the app in development mode, and you can view it in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Running Tests

To run tests for this project, you can use the following command:

```
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details on running tests, please refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your app, you can use the following command to build it for production:

```
npm run build
```

This command will bundle your app in production mode, optimizing it for the best performance. The resulting build files will be located in the `build` folder, and your app will be ready for deployment.

## Features

This practice app currently includes the following features:

- Search page with a list of movies.
- A search tab that returns movie results based on user input.

## Scope for Improvements

While this app provides a solid foundation for React development, there is always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Enhance the user interface with more sophisticated designs and layout.
- Implement a user login page to personalize the user experience.
- Expand search functionality by adding filters like year, genre, and more.

Feel free to contribute to this project and explore these improvements as you continue your React journey. Happy coding!
